        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm now a senior undergraduate student at Northeastern University, 
            majoring in Chemical Engineering and Computer Science, with a minor in Chemistry. 
            I have a passion for studying both software and chemicals. I worked on an online shopping
             website with my groupmates as part of a database design project. I also developed
             a car-sharing website independently, using all the knowledge I've learned, such as
             Python Flask, MySQL database, HTML, and Linux commands. I've been involved in NUSAACS 
            for two years, attending their outdoor activities and helping review and hone other members'
             chemistry knowledge before quizzes and exams. I'm planning to start chemical engineering research,
             possibly in electrochemistry, in my fifth year.</p>

            <strong>Santa Ynez, California, United States | Sep 2023 - Dec 2023</strong><br>
            I worked at Gainey Vineyard as a lab intern from September to December 2023. My responsibilities included daily monitoring of Brix and temperature for fermenting wines, measuring TA and pH values, and determining the concentrations of glucose, malic acid, and acetic acid in wine using enzymatic methods. I meticulously recorded all data in both a daily fermentation logbook and an online Excel sheet for accurate record-keeping.
